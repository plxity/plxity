# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Apoorv. Currently wokring at Razorpay as a Frontend Engineer. 

I have previously worked with Innovaccer, EventGraphia and Cupido as an intern.

In my free time, I like to build projects - 

1. [Look For a Space](lookfora.space) - An application to search for interesting spaces happening on twitter.
2. [ESBuild-cross-browser-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-plugin-cross-browser-css) - An ESBuild plugin to add support from cross browser CSS.
3. [React-Pincode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pincode) - An NPM module which autofills city, state and distric details as you enter a valid pincode. 
4. [Twitter BFF](http://twitterbff.vercel.app/) - A fun app to find your Twitter BFF based on your engagements. Had a reach of **150k** in 2 days.
5. [Spotify Header](https://twitter.com/apoorv_taneja) - An application which updates my twitter header with top played Spotify Tracks in every 24 hours.


I also like to give **tech talks** to share my learnings with the community.
